# Color Coded Gateway

Color Coded Gateway is a PyQt6-based application that allows users to encode and decode numeric values using a color-coded table. The application provides a graphical interface for encoding a gateway number into a color pattern and decoding the color pattern back into the gateway number.

## Features

- Encode: Users can enter a gateway number and encode it into a color pattern represented by a table.
- Decode: Users can mark cells in the table with different colors to represent a color pattern and decode it into the corresponding gateway number.
- Interactive Table: Users can click on cells in the table to toggle their colors, making it easy to create and modify color patterns.
- Error Handling: The application provides error messages to users when they input invalid gateway numbers or create invalid color patterns.
- Theme Switching: Users can switch between light and dark themes for the application interface.
